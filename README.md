# Guinote CLI

An open source terminal (ugly implementation) of the Spanish card game Gui√±ote.

You can try it out by compiling the code yourself or downloading the latest (linux) release from the [releases](https://github.com/v1ctorio/guinotecli/releases)

The current prerelease is only the rendering engine and a little bit of logic. You can select and play cards, render points and all the cards in the spanish deck.
